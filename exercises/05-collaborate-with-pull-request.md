# Exercise 05 – Collaborate with a Pull Request

This exercise helps you practise making a change in a branch and opening a pull request (PR) to suggest merging it into the main project.

---

## What you’ll do

- Create a new branch
- Make a change to a file
- Open a pull request
- (Optional) Review and merge it

---

## Step-by-step

### 1. Create a new branch

In your repository, click the branch dropdown (top-left, next to the “<> Code” tab) and type a new branch name.  
Example:
```
add-contact-section
```

Click **Create branch**.

---

### 2. Make your changes

Navigate to a file such as `README.md`, click the pencil icon to edit it, and add a short “Contact” or “About me” section.

Scroll down and enter a commit message.  
Example:
```
Add contact info section to README
```

Choose to commit **directly to the new branch**, then click **Commit changes**.

---

### 3. Open a pull request

Once committed, GitHub will show a banner offering to compare & pull request. Click the **Compare & pull request** button.

Or you can go to the **Pull requests** tab and click **New pull request**.

Make sure the base branch is `main`, and the compare branch is your new branch.

---

### 4. Write a short PR message

Give it a title like:
```
Add contact section to README
```

In the description, briefly explain what the change does.

Click **Create pull request**.

---

### 5. Review and merge (optional for solo work)

If you're working alone, you can go ahead and click **Merge pull request** to accept the changes into `main`.

If you’re working with others, someone else can review and merge.

## Why it matters

Pull requests let you safely propose changes without breaking the main version. It’s a standard collaboration workflow — even if you're working on your own, it helps track changes more clearly.
