# Exercise 02 – Create a Branch

In this exercise, you’ll learn how to create a new branch in your repository and make changes without affecting the main version.

---

## What you’ll do

- Create a new branch
- Make an edit
- Commit the changes to the new branch

---

## Step-by-step

### 1. Open your repository on GitHub

Navigate to your portfolio repository in your browser.

---

### 2. Create a branch

At the top left, click on the branch dropdown (it should say `main`).

Type the name of your new branch, for example:

```
add-summary-section
```

Press **Enter** to create and switch to the branch.

---

### 3. Edit a file

Click into a file you’d like to update (such as `README.md`) and click the pencil icon (✏️) to edit.

Make your changes, such as adding a short paragraph describing your academic interests or goals.

---

### 4. Commit your changes

Below the edit box, write a short commit message:

```
Add summary section to README
```

Click **Commit changes**.

Your update is now saved in the branch, not in the main version.

---

## What next?

You’ve created a branch and saved your work there. In the next exercise, you’ll learn how to publish your changes with GitHub Pages.
