# Exercise 03 – Publish with GitHub Pages

This exercise helps you publish your repository as a simple website using GitHub Pages.

---

## What you’ll do

- Enable GitHub Pages
- View your portfolio as a public web page

---

## Step-by-step

### 1. Open your repository on GitHub

Navigate to your portfolio repository in your browser.

---

### 2. Go to Settings → Pages

- Click on the **Settings** tab (top of the repo page)
- Scroll down the left-hand sidebar and click on **Pages** (under “Code and automation” or “Pages” directly)

---

### 3. Choose your source

Under **Build and deployment**, look for the **Source** section.

- Select **Deploy from a branch**
- Then select:
  - **Branch**: `main` (or whichever branch you want to publish)
  - **Folder**: `/ (root)`

Click **Save**.

### 4. Wait for the link to appear

After a few moments, a green banner will appear with a link to your published site.

It will look something like this:
```
https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/
```

Click the link to visit your published site!

---

### 5. Check what’s visible

The site will display your `README.md` file by default. To create a custom homepage, you can add an `index.md` or `index.html` later.

---

## That’s it!

Your portfolio is now a public website. Share the link in your CV, LinkedIn profile, or email signature if you're comfortable doing so.

We’ll explore customising it further in future steps.
