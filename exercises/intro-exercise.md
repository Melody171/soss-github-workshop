# Intro Exercise – Explore Your Portfolio Repo

This quick exercise is designed to help you explore the structure of your GitHub-based portfolio and understand how the different folders are used.

---

## What you’ll do

- Look through the structure of your repository
- Understand the purpose of each folder
- Add one short text file to test your setup

---

## Step-by-step

### 1. Open your portfolio repository

Visit your repository on GitHub. You should see folders such as:

<pre>
```text
template/
├── code/
├── data/
├── notes/
├── outputs/
└── README.md
```
</pre>

---

### 2. What each folder is for

Here’s a quick guide:

- `code/` – where your scripts or analysis files go (e.g. R, Python, Stata)
- `data/` – small datasets or cleaned data (don’t include sensitive info)
- `notes/` – summaries, planning docs, rough reflections
- `outputs/` – graphs, tables, or exported results
- `README.md` – an intro page describing your portfolio

These folders help you keep your project tidy and readable — for yourself and for others.

---

### 3. Add a test note

Go to the `notes/` folder and click **Add file → Create new file**. Call it something like:
```
first-reflection.md
```

In the file, write one or two sentences:
- What are you hoping to include in your portfolio?
- What topics or skills do you want to highlight?

Scroll down and **commit** the new file (e.g. message: `Add first reflection`).

### 4. Done!

You've now made your first contribution to your portfolio — well done.

We’ll build on this by adding code, data, and visual outputs over time.
