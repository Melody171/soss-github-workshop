## What is GitHub?

GitHub is an online platform for version control and collaboration. It allows you to store, edit, and track changes to your work over time — whether it’s code, data, writing, or notes.

Everything on GitHub is organised into **repositories**, or "repos", which are like folders for your projects.

## Key terms

- **Repository (repo):** A project folder where all your files are stored
- **Commit:** A saved change with a message describing what you did
- **Branch:** A version of your project where you can make changes without affecting the main version
- **Pull request:** A way to suggest or review changes before adding them to the main project
- **Clone:** A local copy of a GitHub repo that you work on from your own computer
