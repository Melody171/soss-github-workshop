# Using Branches on GitHub

Branches let you work on new ideas without changing your main project until you're ready. They're useful for testing edits, writing new sections, or collaborating with others.

## What is a branch?

A branch is a separate line of development. It’s like making a copy of your repository at a specific point in time. You can make changes there without affecting your main version (usually called `main`).

---

## When to use a branch

- You want to try something new without changing your main files
- You’re working on a longer piece and want to commit it when it’s ready
- You’re collaborating with others on the same project
- You want to practise before pushing to your final version

---

## Creating a branch on GitHub

1. Open your repository on GitHub
2. Click the branch dropdown at the top left (it usually says `main`)
3. In the search box, type a new name for your branch, for example: `feature-about-section`
4. Press Enter to create the branch

You’ll now be switched to this new branch.

---

## Making changes

Once you're on the new branch:
- Edit files as usual
- Create new folders or add content
- Write commits with clear messages

Your changes will stay on the branch until you choose to merge them.

---

## Merging your branch into `main`

1. Go back to the homepage of your repository
2. You should see a **Compare & pull request** button -> click it
3. Add a short title and description (for example, “Added About Me section”)
4. Click **Create pull request**
5. On the next page, click **Merge pull request**
6. Optional: delete the branch after merging

Your updates will now appear on the `main` branch.

## Notes

- You can switch between branches any time using the dropdown menu
- Branches help you keep your work organised and reduce risk of mistakes
- You don’t need to use them all the time, but they’re helpful for bigger edits
