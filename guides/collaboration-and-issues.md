# Collaboration and Using Issues on GitHub

GitHub isn’t just for storing code, it’s also a collaboration tool. You can work with others, suggest changes, track ideas, and organise tasks using built-in features like issues and pull requests.

---

## Working on the same repository

If you’re working in a group or with a mentor, GitHub allows multiple people to contribute to the same project. Depending on your permissions, you can:

- Edit files
- Create branches
- Comment on others’ work
- Open or respond to issues

---

## What are “issues”?

An issue is a way to ask a question, suggest a change, or flag a problem. You can think of them as to-do list items that anyone in the repo can see and respond to.

### How to create an issue:

1. Go to the repository’s main page
2. Click on the **Issues** tab
3. Click **New issue**
4. Add a short title and a longer explanation if needed
5. Submit the issue

Other contributors can then add comments, assign people, or close the issue once it’s resolved.

## Assigning and labelling issues

If you’re working in a group, you can assign issues to a specific person. You can also add labels like:

- `enhancement`: for feature suggestions
- `bug`: for something not working
- `question`: for general queries

These labels make it easier to track what’s going on.

---

## Using comments for feedback

Every issue and pull request includes a comment thread. You can:

- Ask for feedback on your writing or analysis
- Suggest improvements to someone else’s draft
- Ask clarifying questions

Being constructive and respectful helps keep the collaboration productive.

## Tracking progress

You can use the “Projects” or “Milestones” features to track progress across multiple issues. These are optional, but useful if your portfolio or project becomes more complex.

---

## Summary

- Issues are great for organising tasks and inviting feedback
- You can assign them, label them, and close them when resolved
- Use comments to discuss ideas before making changes
